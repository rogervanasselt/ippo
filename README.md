Cost calculations from CAD drawings / STEP files with AI
> 3 January 2024

## Introduction
Working in the manufacturing industry almost whole my career the basis for cost calculations and planning are [(3D) CAD drawings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design).
A universal exchange format for 3D CAD drawings are (human readable) [step files]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21).

As a non professional coder I follow with great interest the [Practical Deep Learning Courses](https://course.fast.ai) by the inspiring [Jeremy Howard](https://course.fast.ai/#your-teacher).

## Idea
So I got this idea a while ago that training an **AI model** with CAD drawings en **STEP files** against (our) **cost calculations** and **planning information** (like setup - and runtimes) possibly can work.
It is in this project I like to find out if this will work. Step bij step (*ippo ippo* in Japanese as a learned from a former boss).

If you like to work on similar cases, please join me in this project.

## Steps
1. Create basics forms with basics outcomes (like volume)
2. Experiment with learning from drawings (images) as well STEP files
3. Experiment with preprocessing STEP files
4. Make combinations of above

5. Start with real cases

## About me
My name is [Roger van Asselt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-van-asselt-4618b352/), Dutch, born in 1967
I work in the [steel industry](https://www.steelconstructions.nl)
And as a hobby I like to follow whats happining in the software world and I like to try things out (from html, javascript, web3gl to graph databases and now also fastai).
Professionally I work with [Business Central](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central) and all the Microsoft Power tools.
